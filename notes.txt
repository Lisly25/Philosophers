LIST OF ALLOWED FUNCTIONS

1. USLEEP

#include <unistd.h>

int usleep(useconds_t usec);

suspend execution for microsecond intervals

The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling thread
       for (at least) usec microseconds.  The sleep may be lengthened
       slightly by any system activity or by the time spent processing
       the call or by the granularity of system timers.

The usleep() function returns 0 on success.  On error, -1 is
       returned, with errno set to indicate the error.

2. GETTIMEOFDAY

#include <sys/time.h>

int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tv, struct timezone *_Nullable restrict tz);

The tv argument is a struct timeval (as specified in
       <sys/time.h>):

           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };

       and gives the number of seconds and microseconds since the Epoch
      (The Epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC))

The tz argument is a struct timezone: its use is obsolete; the tz argument should normally be specified as NULL

The function returns 0 for success.  On error, -1 is returned

3. PTHREAD_CREATE

#include <pthread.h>

 int pthread_create(pthread_t *restrict thread,
                   const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
                   void *(*start_routine)(void *),
                   void *restrict arg);
